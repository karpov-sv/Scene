<h1>The Workspace</h1>
<p>
    The workspace is divided into three areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Binder sidebar</strong> (left) &mdash; chapter and scene navigation.</li>
    <li><strong>Main panel</strong> (center) &mdash; switches between the Writing editor and the Workshop chat.</li>
    <li><strong>Side panel</strong> (right) &mdash; toggles between Compendium, Summary, Notes, and Conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Toggle the binder with <code>Cmd-1</code>. Switch the main panel between Writing
    (<code>Cmd-2</code>) and Workshop (<code>Cmd-3</code>). Toggle side panels with
    <code>Cmd-4</code> through <code>Cmd-7</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Both Writing and Workshop views are kept alive when you switch tabs &mdash; scroll position,
    undo history, and editor state are preserved.
</p>

<a name="binder"></a>
<h2>Binder &mdash; Chapters &amp; Scenes</h2>
<p>
    The Binder sidebar shows your project's structure as a tree of chapters and scenes.
</p>
<h3>Creating content</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click the <strong>+</strong> button at the top of the binder to add a new chapter.</li>
    <li>Right-click a chapter or use its context menu to add a scene within it.</li>
    <li>Double-click a chapter or scene title to rename it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reordering</h3>
<p>
    Drag and drop chapters or scenes to reorder them. Scenes can be moved between chapters.
    The order you set in the binder determines the reading order used for export and chapter-level
    operations.
</p>
<h3>Deleting</h3>
<p>
    Right-click a chapter or scene and choose <strong>Delete</strong>. Deleting a chapter also
    removes all of its scenes.
