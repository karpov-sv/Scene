<h1>Checkpoints &amp; History</h1>
<p>
    Checkpoints are timestamped snapshots of your entire project. Use them to save milestone
    versions and roll back when needed.
</p>
<h3>Managing checkpoints</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Checkpoints &rarr; Create</strong> &mdash; save a snapshot of the current project state.</li>
    <li><strong>Checkpoints &rarr; Restore&hellip;</strong> &mdash; browse checkpoints and restore
        with options for selective scope and behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Checkpoints &rarr; Scene History</strong> &mdash; view the history of the current
        scene across all checkpoints, with diffs against the current version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scene history</h3>
<p>
    The Scene History viewer shows how a scene has changed over time. You can compare any historical
    version against the current text (diff view) and restore just the scene text from a specific
    checkpoint without affecting the rest of the project.
